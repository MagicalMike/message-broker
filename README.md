# Message Broker
## Introduction
This is a collection of apps built using Cocoa and Swift 4 for the OSX containing:
* The _Sender_ application, design to send messages to the server
* The _Server_ application, that receives, processes and sends messages to the _Receiver_
* The _Receiver_ application, that obtains and displays the messages
